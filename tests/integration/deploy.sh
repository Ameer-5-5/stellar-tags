# Deploys the payment_router Soroban contract to the local standalone
# Stellar network started by docker-compose.yml's integration profile.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Docker running with the standalone network up:
#       docker compose --profile integration up -d stellar-standalone
#   - The `soroban` CLI installed (https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/reference/cli)
#   - Rust toolchain with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:
#       rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
#
# Outputs the deployed contract ID to stdout and writes it to
# tests/integration/.contract-id so the integration test can read it.
